# Car Race Project

This project demonstrates a car race competition, using the chainlink oracles to determine and automate our verifiably random winner. It comes with a complex contract, tests (staging and unit tests) for this contract, the mock deployment (development chains) and the rinkeby deployment (testnet) for this contract.
